<b>Travelocity </b> is a platform where the users can enter the name of a place and find the hotels in that area and make a booking right away.<br/>
Once the user enters the place name and searches for the hotels, the user will also get an option to sort or filter the data as per their choice. Also the user can search by the hotel name if he wishes to search for a particular hotel.

<h3> Searching and Sorting Options : </h3>

Here once you open a hotel page after selecting a hotel the details will be added to the booking form automatically and you will get an alert to confirm the booking.

Once you make a booking the trip details will be available on the trips page which you can access from the navbar.
